# AB_Testing_Mobile_Games

- Analyzed the results of an A/B test run by a mobile game company, based on users churn rate for different gaming stages
- Using non-parametric test (bootstrapping method) it turned out that the control group (current) has higher user engagement & retention rate for 1 day, and 7 days after first installation 
- I have run logistic regression in order to find other variables that might influence retention rate than stage. Unfortunatlely I couldn't find any factor that works as a lever to the rate
- Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and SciPy
